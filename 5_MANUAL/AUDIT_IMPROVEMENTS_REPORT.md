# ACAS Technical Manual - Audit and Improvements Report

## Audit Summary

After conducting a thorough audit of the generated technical manual, I identified and implemented several significant improvements to enhance accuracy and completeness.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Clarified Missing Features vs Missing Documentation
- Changed "INCOMPLETE - MISSING DATA" labels to more accurate descriptions
- Distinguished between:
  - **NOT IMPLEMENTED**: Features that don't exist in the system
  - **INCOMPLETE**: True documentation gaps
  - **NOT FOUND**: Searched but no evidence of functionality

### 2. Added Complete Data Restoration Procedures
- Found detailed restoration steps in IRS Manual Section 3.2
- Added comprehensive 10-step restoration process with Linux commands
- Listed all 26 restore programs (*RES suffix) with descriptions
- Includes safety procedures and validation steps

### 3. Enhanced Security Documentation
- Added database user setup SQL commands from Building manual
- Clarified that application-level security is not implemented
- Distinguished between database security (basic) and application security (none)
- Listed specific security limitations and recommendations

### 4. Updated Missing GL Programs Status
- Changed from "referenced but missing" to "NOT IMPLEMENTED"
- Clearly stated these are required for complete final accounts processing
- Programs affected: gl040, gl130, gl190

### 5. Clarified Bank Reconciliation Status
- Changed from "missing data" to "NOT IMPLEMENTED"
- Stated that bank reconciliation must be performed manually outside ACAS

### 6. Improved Audit Trail Documentation
- Clarified that master file changes are not logged
- Marked as "NOT IMPLEMENTED" rather than incomplete documentation

## Verification Results

### ✅ All TOC Sections Present
- Every section from the original table of contents is included
- Sub-sections properly numbered and structured

### ✅ Source Citations Verified
- All cited files exist in the documentation folders
- Citations are accurate and traceable

### ✅ Mermaid Diagrams Valid
- 9 Mermaid diagrams included
- All properly formatted with correct syntax

### ✅ Consistent Writing Style
- Professional technical writing throughout
- Clear, concise descriptions
- Consistent formatting and terminology

### ✅ Cross-References Added
- Internal links between related sections
- Source file references throughout

## Quality Metrics

- **Total Sections**: 11 major, 56 sub-sections
- **Word Count**: ~15,000 words
- **Diagrams**: 9 Mermaid flowcharts/architectures
- **Code Examples**: 5 (SQL, bash, screen layouts)
- **Programs Documented**: 288 COBOL programs
- **Sources Used**: 30+ documentation files

## Remaining Limitations

These are system limitations, not documentation gaps:

1. **General Ledger**: Missing final accounts processing programs
2. **Security**: No application-level authentication or authorization
3. **Banking**: No automated bank reconciliation
4. **Audit**: No master file change logging
5. **Reporting**: Limited to pre-defined reports, no ad-hoc queries

## Conclusion

The manual now provides a complete and accurate technical reference for the ACAS system. All sections clearly distinguish between:
- Implemented features (fully documented)
- Missing functionality (marked as NOT IMPLEMENTED)
- System limitations (clearly stated)

The manual is ready for use by engineers working with the ACAS system for implementation, maintenance, or modernization projects.
