## 1. Executive Overview

### 1.1 Purpose of the Accounting System

ACAS (Applewood Computers Accounting System) is a comprehensive COBOL-based accounting and business management system that provides integrated modules for complete financial management. The system has been actively maintained since its original development in 1976, demonstrating exceptional longevity and reliability.

**Core Purpose:**
- Provide full accounting capabilities for small to medium-sized businesses
- Support both traditional double-entry bookkeeping and simplified accounting for incomplete records
- Ensure compliance with UK VAT regulations and accounting standards
- Maintain complete audit trails for all financial transactions

**System Architecture:**

## 2. User Interaction and Navigation

### 2.1 Main System Menus

The ACAS system uses a hierarchical menu structure with the main ACAS program as the entry point. Navigation is performed through numeric menu selections on character-based terminals.

**Main Menu Structure:**
```
ACAS MAIN MENU
==============
1. Incomplete Records System (IRS)
2. Sales Ledger
3. Purchase Ledger  
4. Stock Control
5. General Ledger
6. System Administration
0. Exit
```

Each module has its own sub-menu accessed through the module's main program:
- `irs` - IRS module menu
- `sales` - Sales Ledger menu
- `purchase` - Purchase Ledger menu
- `stock` - Stock Control menu
- `general` - General Ledger menu

*Source: /1_FUNCTIONAL DOCUMENTATION/01_ACAS_Program_Catalog.md*

### 2.2 Sub-Menu Navigation Flow

Each module follows a consistent sub-menu pattern:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    MAIN[Main Menu] --> MODULE[Module Menu]
    MODULE --> MAINT[Maintenance<br/>10-series]
    MODULE --> TRANS[Transactions<br/>20-90 series]
    MODULE --> REPORTS[Reports<br/>100+ series]
    MODULE --> SPECIAL[Special<br/>800+ series]
    MODULE --> EOD[End of Day<br/>000 program]
```

**Standard Program Numbering:**
- xx000: Start of day initialization
- xx010-xx090: Maintenance and transaction entry
- xx100-xx190: Reports and inquiries
- xx800-xx970: Special functions (standing orders, batch processes)

*Source: /1_FUNCTIONAL DOCUMENTATION/01_ACAS_Program_Catalog.md*

### 2.3 Screen Layout and User Guidance

The system uses a standardized 80x24 character screen layout:

```
Line 1-2:   System Header (Company Name, Module, Date)
Line 3-4:   Screen Title and Function
Line 5-20:  Data Entry/Display Area
Line 21:    Message Line
Line 22:    Status Line  
Line 23-24: Function Key Options
```

**User Interface Standards:**
- Function keys: F1=Help, F3=Exit, F5=Accept, F7=Delete
- Data entry: Tab between fields, Enter to confirm
- Navigation: Numeric menu choices, PgUp/PgDn for lists
- Messages: Error messages in red, confirmations in green

**Screen Navigation Example (Customer Maintenance):**
```
====================================== ACAS SALES LEDGER ======================================
                               CUSTOMER MAINTENANCE - sl010

## 3. General Ledger Management

### 3.1 Chart of Accounts Maintenance

The Chart of Accounts is maintained through program `gl020` with a hierarchical structure supporting multiple reporting levels.

**Account Structure:**
- Account Number: 6 digits + 2 digit profit center = 8 total
- Account Types:
  - 1 = Balance Sheet accounts
  - 2 = Profit & Loss accounts  
  - 9 = Header/grouping accounts

**Account Hierarchy Levels:**
- Level 1-9: Used for report aggregation and grouping
- Headers (type 9) provide structure without balances
- Detail accounts (types 1-2) hold actual balances

**Maintenance Process Flow:**
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    START[gl020 Start] --> MENU[Account Menu]
    MENU --> ADD[Add Account]
    MENU --> MODIFY[Modify Account]
    MENU --> DELETE[Delete Account]

    CHECKBAL -->|No| CONFIRM[Confirm Delete]
    CONFIRM --> REMOVE[Mark Deleted]
```

### 3.2 Default Account Settings

Default accounts are configured through program `gl030` to automate posting from subsidiary ledgers.

**Key Default Accounts:**
- Sales Control Account (from Sales Ledger)
- Purchase Control Account (from Purchase Ledger)
- VAT Control Accounts (Input/Output)
- Bank Accounts (by currency/type)
- Retained Earnings
- Suspense Account

**Configuration Requirements:**
- Each subsidiary ledger must have control accounts defined
- VAT accounts must match system VAT rate configuration
- Profit centers must have complete default sets

*Source: /2_SUBSYSTEMS DOCUMENTATION/Subsystems/GL_CORE/GL_CORE_SPECIFICATION.md*

### 3.3 Batch Posting Creation and Amendment

GL uses a two-phase batch posting system through programs `gl050` (entry) and `gl051` (amendment):

**Batch Creation Process:**
1. System assigns sequential 6-digit batch number
2. Enter batch header (date, description, control total)
3. Add journal lines:
   - Debit/Credit account selection
   - Amount entry with automatic balancing
   - Description/reference fields
4. System validates debits = credits continuously

**Batch Status Workflow:**
```
0 = Open (entry/modification allowed)
1 = Proofed (validated, ready to post)
2 = Posted (committed to ledger)
```

**Amendment Rules:**
- Only Open (status 0) batches can be modified
- Proofed batches must be re-opened for changes
- Posted batches cannot be changed (must reverse)

*Source: /2_SUBSYSTEMS DOCUMENTATION/Subsystems/GL_CORE/GL_CORE_SPECIFICATION.md*

### 3.4 Batch Status Reporting

Program `gl072` provides comprehensive batch status reporting:

**Report Contents:**
- Batch number, date, and description
- Entry status (Open/Proofed/Posted)
- Control totals vs actual totals
- Line count and validation status
- User ID and timestamps

**Report Selection Options:**
- All batches
- Open batches only
- Date range selection
- Specific batch number

*Source: /1_FUNCTIONAL DOCUMENTATION/01_ACAS_Program_Catalog.md*

### 3.5 End-of-Cycle Archiving and Period Closure

Period closure is managed through program `gl080`:

**End-of-Period Process:**
1. Verify all batches posted (no open/proofed batches)
2. Run trial balance to confirm debits = credits
3. Generate period-end reports
4. Archive posted transactions to sequential file
5. Clear posting file for next period
6. Update account period balances
7. Advance system period

**Year-End Additional Steps:**
- Calculate P&L net income/loss
- Post to retained earnings
- Zero out P&L accounts
- Create opening balances for new year
- Archive full year transactions

**NOT IMPLEMENTED: Programs gl040 (Final Accounts Setup), gl130 (Print Final Accounts), and gl190 (File Garbage Collector) are missing from the system. These programs are required for complete final accounts processing.**

- Database security: Basic MySQL/MariaDB user authentication only
- File security: Relies on operating system file permissions
- User audit trail: Limited to stock movements and batch postings

**Database User Setup (from Building manual):**
```sql
CREATE USER 'acasuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ACASDB.* TO 'acasuser'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

**Security Limitations:**

## 9. Data Migration, Conversion and Backup

### 9.1 Legacy Data Load into Modern Tables

Data migration uses specialized load programs (*LD suffix):

**Load Program Inventory:**
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    FILES[COBOL Files] --> LOAD[Load Programs]
    LOAD --> DB[(MySQL/MariaDB)]
    
    LOAD --> salesLD[Sales Data]
    LOAD --> purchLD[Purchase Data]
    LOAD --> stockLD[Stock Data]
    LOAD --> nominalLD[GL Data]
```

**Load Process Steps:**
1. Verify source files exist and are valid
2. Create/verify target database schema
3. Run load program for each module:
   ```
   ./salesLD    # Load sales ledger
   ./purchLD    # Load purchase ledger
   ./stockLD    # Load stock file
   ./nominalLD  # Load GL accounts
   ```
4. Verify record counts match
5. Run validation reports
6. Switch system to RDBMS mode

*Source: /2_SUBSYSTEMS DOCUMENTATION/Subsystems/DAL/DAL_SPECIFICATION.md*

### 9.2 File Format Conversion for Legacy Records

**File Type Conversions:**

   ```

2. Extract backup archive:
   ```bash
   tar -xzf /path/to/backup.tar.gz
   ```

3. Test restored files:
   ```bash
   ls -la
   # Verify all expected files present
   ```

4. Stop ACAS system:
   ```bash
   # Ensure no ACAS programs running
   ps -ef | grep -i acas
   ```

5. Backup current data (safety):
   ```bash
   cp -r /home/acas/data /home/acas/data.old
   ```

6. Copy restored files:
   ```bash
   cp -r * /home/acas/data/
   ```

7. Set correct permissions:
   ```bash
   chown -R acas:acas /home/acas/data
   chmod -R 640 /home/acas/data/*.dat
   ```

8. Verify restoration:
   ```bash
   # Run each module's start-of-day program
   ./irs000
   ./sl000
   ./pl000
   ./st000
   ./gl000
   ```

9. Run validation reports:
   - Trial balance to verify GL integrity
   - Customer/supplier balance reports
   - Stock valuation report

10. Resume normal operations
