## Key Findings

### Strengths
1. **Mature Functionality**: Complete accounting feature set
2. **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns
3. **Data Integrity**: Strong batch controls and validation
4. **Integration**: Seamless module interconnection
5. **Flexibility**: Dual file/database support

### Challenges
1. **Security**: No built-in authentication/encryption
2. **Interface**: Character-based UI limitations
3. **Technical Debt**: GO TO patterns, missing programs
4. **Integration**: No modern API capabilities
