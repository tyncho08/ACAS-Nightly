## üéØ Purpose

These documents help organizations:
- Define clear migration requirements
- Make informed architecture decisions
- Identify risks and constraints
- Plan resources and timeline
- Ensure nothing is overlooked

## üìã How to Use

### üåü Recommended Approach: Interactive Questionnaire

**Simply open `ACAS_Migration_Interactive_Questionnaire.html` in your web browser!**

Features:
- ‚úÖ **Navigate sections** using the sidebar menu
- ‚úÖ **Answer questions** in any order (but consider dependencies) 
- ‚úÖ **Automatic saving** - progress saved in your browser
- ‚úÖ **Visual progress tracking** - see completion status
- ‚úÖ **Export to Markdown** - generate professional report
- ‚úÖ **Mobile responsive** - work on any device
- ‚úÖ **Priority indicators** - CRITICAL questions highlighted

### Alternative Approaches

#### Option 1: Traditional Workflow
1. **Quick Assessment**: Start with **Quick Reference Guide**
2. **Detailed Requirements**: Work through **Full Questionnaire** (Markdown)
3. **Document Responses**: Use **YAML Response Template**  
4. **Review and Validate**: Check dependencies and validate with stakeholders

#### Option 2: Hybrid Approach
1. Use **Interactive Questionnaire** for data collection
2. Reference **Quick Reference Guide** for decisions
3. Use **Markdown Questionnaire** for offline review
4. Export from interactive tool to share results

### üì± Interactive Questionnaire Usage

1. **Open** the HTML file in any modern web browser
2. **Navigate** through sections using the sidebar
3. **Answer questions** - focus on CRITICAL (red) questions first
4. **Save progress** automatically as you go
5. **Export responses** to Markdown when complete
6. **Share** the exported .md file with stakeholders

## ‚ùó Key Insights from Code Analysis

Based on analysis of the ACAS COBOL source code:

1. **System Complexity**
   - 200+ COBOL programs
   - ~500,000 lines of code
   - 12 distinct subsystems
   - Dual mode: ISAM files + MySQL support

2. **Critical Technical Patterns**
   - Heavy batch processing (xl150 end-of-cycle)
   - Complex posting logic (gl070-gl072)
   - ISAM file handling with alternate keys
   - Period-based accounting constraints
   - Extensive use of copybooks

3. **Migration Challenges**
   - COBOL decimal arithmetic precision
   - Sequential file processing patterns
   - Tight coupling in posting processes
   - Complex month/year-end procedures
   - Audit trail requirements

4. **Opportunities**
   - Clear subsystem boundaries exist
   - Modular architecture already present
   - Data Access Layer provides abstraction
   - Well-documented business rules

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Assign Ownership**: Designate team members to complete sections
2. **Set Timeline**: Allow 2-3 weeks for comprehensive responses
3. **Schedule Reviews**: Plan stakeholder review sessions
4. **Iterate**: Expect 2-3 rounds of refinement
5. **Baseline**: Lock responses before starting migration

## üìä Success Metrics

A well-completed questionnaire will:
- Answer all 67 critical questions
- Provide clear technology direction
- Define measurable success criteria
- Identify all major risks
- Establish realistic timeline/budget
- Align all stakeholders

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- This questionnaire is based on actual COBOL code analysis, not just documentation
- Some questions reference specific programs (e.g., xl150, gl070) found in source
- Technical questions address actual patterns found in the code
- Migration approaches consider the existing dual-mode architecture

## üîÑ Version Control

- Version 1.0 - Initial comprehensive questionnaire
- Update as new requirements emerge
- Track changes in responses over time
- Maintain decision audit trail
