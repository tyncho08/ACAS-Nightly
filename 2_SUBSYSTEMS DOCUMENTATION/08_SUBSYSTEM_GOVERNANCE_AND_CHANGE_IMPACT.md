# ACAS Subsystem Governance Model and Change Impact Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document establishes the governance framework for managing ACAS subsystems and provides a comprehensive change impact analysis methodology. It defines ownership, responsibilities, change control processes, and impact assessment procedures to ensure system stability while enabling controlled evolution.

## Subsystem Governance Framework

### Governance Principles

1. **Subsystem Autonomy**: Each subsystem maintains internal cohesion with minimal external dependencies
2. **Clear Ownership**: Every subsystem has a designated technical owner and business sponsor
3. **Interface Stability**: Public interfaces are versioned and changes are backward compatible
4. **Documentation Requirements**: All changes must be documented with business and technical rationale
5. **Testing Mandate**: Changes require comprehensive testing including integration scenarios

### Ownership Matrix

| Subsystem | Technical Owner Role | Business Sponsor | Primary Responsibilities |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| GL_CORE | Financial Systems Lead | CFO/Controller | GL structure, posting rules, financial integrity |
| IRS_CORE | Financial Systems Lead | Small Business Manager | IRS ledger, simplified accounting |
| SL_MGMT | Sales Systems Lead | Sales Director | Customer management, revenue processes |
| PL_MGMT | Procurement Lead | Purchasing Manager | Supplier management, payables |
| ST_CTRL | Inventory Lead | Warehouse Manager | Stock control, valuation |
| BATCH_FW | Technical Architect | IT Manager | Batch processing, scheduling |
| RPT_ENGINE | BI Developer | All Departments | Reporting, analytics |
| SYS_ADMIN | System Administrator | IT Manager | Configuration, parameters |
| PERIOD_PROC | Finance Systems Lead | CFO/Controller | Period management, closing |
| DAL | Database Architect | IT Manager | Data access, storage |
| COMMON_UTIL | Technical Architect | IT Manager | Shared utilities, standards |
| INTEG_SVC | Integration Architect | IT Manager | Data exchange, migration |
