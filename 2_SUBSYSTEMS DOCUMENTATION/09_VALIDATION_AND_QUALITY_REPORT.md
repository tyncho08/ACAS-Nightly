### 2. Diagram Enhancement
- **Observation**: Current diagrams are text-based (Mermaid)
- **Recommendation**: Consider professional diagramming tools for presentations
- **Priority**: Low

### 3. Performance Metrics
- **Observation**: Some performance targets are estimates
- **Recommendation**: Validate with actual measurements
- **Priority**: Medium

### 4. Modern Integration Patterns
- **Observation**: Current integration is file-based
